# Designing-a-DC-DC-Buck-Converter
this report outlines the design process of a DC-DC buck converter that convert 8 V input to 3 V output with less than 0.5% output voltage ripple. The design includes calculating duty ratio, component values, and semiconductor stress. Arduino microcontroller and IR2110 gate driver IC is used for this respective implementation. The design is verified through simulation and measurements on PSIM software. The circuit was fabricated on a PCB, and measurement points were made available to measure the high side driver gating waveform, voltage across the drain to source of the MOSFET, inductor voltage, and output voltage.
